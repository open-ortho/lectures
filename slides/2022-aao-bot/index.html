						<li class="fragment">
							Today's research is embarrassingly based on a tiny fraction of our population (&lt; 100

				<h3>Data Conversion</h3>
				<div class="r-stack">
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							A lot of time and resources spend for data conversion (import and export)

				<h2>Strategic Plan of the Past</h2>
				<p class="">
					Attempts have been made in the past, but they failed. Why?
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="fragment">We have used closed interoperability</li>
					<li class="fragment">Fear of losing customers</li>
					<li class="fragment">It's work to follow standards</li>
					<li class="fragment">No request from customers</li>
					<li class="fragment">Lack of Information</li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">
					<h3>Losing customers</h3>
					<p>You can't be so shortsighted that you only see the negatives. See what happened with Sony's
						Betamax standard, which they wanted to license.</p>

				<h2>How can the AAO get involved</h2>

					<li class="fragment">

				<h2>Interoperability Guidelines</h2>
				<ol>
					<li class="fragment">
						A developer should always make use of existing
						standards
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">
						If there are no standards, a developer is expected to
						invent their own standard.
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">
						When a new standard is invented, it shall be made
						public, and eventually adopted by and SDO.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<aside class="notes">
					<ul>
						<li>
							A developer should always make use of an existing,
							public, open, machine-readable and recognized standard
							format for exporting, importing and interchanging all of
							the data. (The intention is to prevent developers from
							holding on to the data the user has added).

						</li>
						<li>
							If a developer is developing a novel product,
							for which no such standard exists yet, the
							developer can invent their own format, as long
							as it is made public, and open for usage by
							anyone. (The intention is to allow technological
							innovation, while maintaining interoperability).
							In such circumstance:
						</li>

						<ul>

							<li>
								the developer shall facilitate/promote the
								standardization of this format through a
								recognized SDO. (The intention is that this
								new format becomes official and implemented
								by others as well)
							</li>

							<li>
								if a new versions of the format is
								necessary, the developer shall maintain
								backwards compatibility with the previously
								used format, either directly (within the new
								version of the product itself), or by
								developing and making publicly available
								open-source conversion tools.
							</li>

							<li>
								in any event, any subsequent format changes
								and revisions shall be made publicly
								available for usage, implementation and
								development, just as the first one. (The
								intention is to prevent possible abuse of
								this regulation by making the first format
								public and open, but then making revisions
								closed and proprietary)

				<h3>The "FAIR" Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship</h3>
				<div class="r-stack">
					<p class="fragment current-visible">
						<b>FINDABILITY</b>: (meta)data are assigned a globally unique
						and persistent identifier; data are described with rich
						metadata; metadata clearly and explicitly include the
						identifier of the data it describes; (meta)data are
						registered or indexed in a searchable resource
					</p>
					<p class="fragment current-visible">
						<b>ACCESSIBILITY</b>: (meta)data are retrievable by their
						identifier using a standardized communications protocol;
						this protocol is open, free, and universally
						implementable, and allows for an authentication and
						authorization procedure, where necessary; metadata are
						accessible, even when the data are no longer available
					</p>
					<p class="fragment current-visible">
						<b>INTEROPERABILITY</b>: (meta)data use a formal, accessible,
						shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge
						representation; they use vocabularies that follow FAIR
						principles; they include qualified references to other
						(meta)data
					</p>
					<p class="fragment current-visible">
						<b>REUSABILITY</b>: (meta)data are richly described with a
						plurality of accurate and relevant attributes; they are
						released with a clear and accessible data usage license;
						they are associated with detailed provenance; they meet
						domain-relevant community standards

				<h3>
					Ask you software's support these questions
				</h3>
				<p>
					Find out if you really have control over your data.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The day I decide to move to a different software
						product, what will the process to export my
						data and import it into the new software be?
					</li>
					<li>
						I would like to use Software B to send out my email
						reminders. Can you please ensure the two software
						products can share data both ways?
