I've been an orthodontist for 40 years. In that time I've seen a lot of change
in our tools — CBCT, 3D intraoral scans, AI-driven analyses — but there's a
hidden problem in clinical informatics that most of us don't see until it hits
us.

Here are three short, real examples you should hear from me, not as theory but
from experience:

- I stopped using a cephalometric tracing product I no longer liked. When I
stopped paying, the company cut off access to years of my tracings. Those were
hundreds of hours of work I could no longer reach. I didn't lose a paycheck that
day, but I lost work I depended on — patient records, follow‑up references,
teaching material. That time is gone.

- I had a problem with an imaging system recently: patients were duplicated,
same patient with different patient IDs, it was a mess caused by various
transitions between systems and poor integrations. After days of collaboration
between the vendor and my IT guy, the best and quickest proposed fix was blunt:
"If only we could Wipe your database and start fresh this shouldn't happen
anymore." I was stunned —  Their answer made me realize how irrealistic our
assumptions are about data ownership and portability.

- Dr. Carla Evans while she was head of the orthodonic department at UIC,
	experienced the department switching practice-management software: She was
	baffled when at the deployment day, the software company failed and didn't
	import anything at all from their previous system! They ended up with
	patients re-registering because the transfer didn't bring the records.
    
- Here's a photograph i took of a colleague of mine at a meeting not knowing a
practical way for sharing a radiograph safely, so he literally took a photograph
of the laptop screen with a phone. These are not edge cases; they are symptoms.

Why this matters: patient care and clinician time. Missing or locked data
interrupts continuity of care, wastes hours of clinical and administrative work,
and creates real risks for patients. Not to mention the ridiculous limitation it
imposes on clinical research.

Here's the thing that saved me: now I keep my images in a non‑proprietary
container, a PACS. Because my imaging data lived outside that vendor's
proprietary lock, I could afford to wipe the vendor's database and continue
clinical operations. That one practical step makes the difference between
permanent loss and permanent data retention.

This is what clinical informatics is about: data portability, standards, safe
export, reliable backups, and asking vendors the right questions up front. It
isn't glamorous, but it's essential. If you are not convinced, ask your vendors
and IT: show me how I can export my data, all of it, **in bulk**, in some format
that is standard, that I can use for research or with another system. Don't let
them brush you off, demand a demo, then look at the data exported.

We owe it to our patients and to our time to see this hidden problem and fix it.
Thank you.
