    <h2>Names Are Messy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="fragment"><strong>Biomedical / health informatics</strong> is the umbrella.</li>
        <li class="fragment">The prefix changes by org: clinical, public health, imaging, nursing, etc.</li>
        <li class="fragment">Always ask what they mean: <em>workflows, research, or plumbing?</em></li>

            <li>Real-world usage is inconsistent; different orgs use different prefixes before "informatics". OHSU makes this explicit and uses "biomedical and health informatics" (BMHI) as the most comprehensive umbrella: https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/medical-informatics-and-clinical-epidemiology/what-biomedical-informatics</li>
            <li>"Medical informatics" is often a legacy synonym for the broader field; in some contexts it is used more narrowly (eg, physician-focused clinical informatics). AMIA discusses this shift: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3534470/</li>
            <li>ABPM frames Clinical Informatics as a physician subspecialty centered on clinical workflows, decision support, and clinical information systems: https://www.theabpm.org/become-certified/subspecialties/clinical-informatics/</li>
            <li>MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) is NLM's controlled vocabulary for indexing biomedical literature; useful as a baseline taxonomy, not a guarantee of everyday usage: https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/</li>
