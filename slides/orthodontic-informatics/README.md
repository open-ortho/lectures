# Orthodontic Informatics

This course is an introduction to medical/dental informatics for dental and orthodontic students.

## Goal

The point is not to turn clinicians into software engineers. The goal is to help future providers:

- M1
  - Reduce lock-in risk (including the risk of losing access to patient data). M1
  - Understand the hidden overhead costs of proprietary formats, brittle interfaces, and one-off workflows.
- M2
  - Set reasonable expectations for vendors and integrations.
- M3
  - Identify the role of the provider in informatics: they are not just the consumer (as tends to be the case now), they also need to be the drivers for requirements (M3, when standards and SDOs are covered).
- M4
  - Choose software more intentionally (and choose what to avoid)

The course is organized into four modules, each delivered as a 1h lecture, using its own reveal.js slide deck.

## Modules

- Module 1: Problem framing - why informatics matters, what breaks, and how data sharing fails.
- Module 2: Workflow + infrastructure - how data should flow through a clinic by the means of databases, storage, and interfaces.
- Module 3: Interoperability - proprietary vs open standards, how standards get built, and how the community tests them.
- Module 4 (draft): "What is the best software out there?" - how to evaluate products and vendors to find what is best for you.
