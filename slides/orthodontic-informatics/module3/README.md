# Orthodontic Informatics - Module 3

## Goal

Explain interoperability strategies and how standards-based ecosystems work, so students can recognize
vendor lock-in patterns and understand how open standards reduce long-term integration cost.

## Key Points Covered

- Proprietary interoperability: one-off bridges, duplicated effort, and brittle upgrades.
- Open standards interoperability: shared contracts, re-usable tooling, and more predictable integrations.
- How standards get created and maintained (the development process).
- What is going on in the broader healthcare interoperability world.
- Connectathons: why community testing matters and how conformance is validated.
