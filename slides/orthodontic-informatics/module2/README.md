# Orthodontic Informatics - Module 2

## Goal

Make the clinical workflow concrete. Students should be able to describe who the actors are, what systems exist,
how images/data are requested and acquired, and what the underlying technical building blocks are.

## Key Points Covered

- Actors in clinical informatics (people + systems).
- Image workflow overview: requesting images, acquiring images, and where the data goes.
- How systems talk: interfaces, networks, and why integration breaks.
- Fundamentals: databases, storage, and basic interface patterns.
- "Mental model" of a clinic as a network of systems, not a single application.
