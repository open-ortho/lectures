# Orthodontic Informatics - Module 4 (Draft)

## Goal

Answer the question students ask from day one: "What is the best software out there?"

This module is meant to teach students how to figure out what the best software is for them:

- What questions to ask.
- What to look for in data portability and interoperability.
- How to approach vendors and evaluate claims.
- How to avoid lock-in, surprise costs, and long-term data risk.

## Current State

Module 4 is currently a draft and will be expanded/refined later.

## Key Points Covered (Current Draft)

- Practical actions clinics can take (including contract and procurement posture).
- When PACS/archiving concepts matter.
- How to ask about software support and interoperability in vendor conversations.
