# Orthodontic Informatics - Module 4 (Draft)

## Goal

Prepare students to evaluate software in the real world:

- What questions to ask (and how to validate answers).
- How to spot hidden interoperability features (e.g., DICOM that is not enabled).
- How to prove interoperability with neutral tools (Horos, Weasis, MicroDicom, Orthanc).
- How to avoid lock-in, surprise costs, and long-term data risk.

## Key Points Covered

- Evaluation framework: portability, interoperability, resilience, total cost.
- Demo and procurement playbook (export, import, bidirectional integration).
- Hidden i14y features and how to activate/test them.
- Owning the archive (PACS/VNA, starting small).
