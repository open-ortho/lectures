# Orthodontic Informatics - Module 1

## Goal

Introduce why informatics matters in orthodontic practice by focusing on the real problems students will run into:
data sharing, integration friction, vendor lock-in, and the long-term cost of poorly designed systems.

## Key Points Covered

- Clinical informatics "paradox": software is essential, yet workflows are often fragile and frustrating.
- The core problems: repeated manual work, disconnected systems, and data that does not move.
- Why data sharing is hard in practice (formats, ownership, incentives, business models).
- What "interoperability" means at a practical level for a clinic.
- Where orthodontics tends to be today and what better looks like.
