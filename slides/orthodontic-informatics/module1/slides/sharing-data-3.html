                            Awareness of data ownership is growing and governments are adding regulations (21st Century

                            Just like there are patients who try to make money by catching medical providers make
                            clinical mistakes, there will soon be more and more patients doing the same with how
                            clinical data is handled.

                            Example of Lisy: patient wanted to sew for incorrect dosage of radiopharmaceutical. However,
                            hospital was tracking everything, and patient couldn't go anywhere. But if patient would
                            have accused the hospital of improper data handling, they would have scored without
                            problems. It's like shooting blindfolded: you will hit someone, if everyone is doing it.
