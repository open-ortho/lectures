                    Most software will let you import or export patient data like photographs or radiographs, in some
                    cases even in DICOM. However, orthodontic software will typically not let you export the work you
                    did with their software (like anatomical landmark selection, image type identification, clinical
                    entries, treatment plans, ...) using a standard machine readable way in such a way to let you
                    continue your work from another software. They might let you export in some non-modifiable format,
                    like PDF, composite images or screenshots. Do you see the difference?
