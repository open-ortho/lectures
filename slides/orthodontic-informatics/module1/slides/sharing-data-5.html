                <p>How do i transition to a new system?</p>
                <img alt="A long line of patients stands outside the dental department at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). They are waiting on the sidewalk, with a nearby grassy area and trees, to re-register into the dental clinic's new practice management system. The queue formed because the new software company was unable to import basic demographic information, necessitating re-registration. A man in a blue shirt walks past the line, and several cars are parked along the adjacent road."

                    switched from Windent to AxiUm.

                            This is one way of doing it: just re-enter all of the information by hand!

                            This doesn't feel like a very efficient way of using computers. Can you come up with a
                            better way? How would you do it?

                            These are real world situation, guys: this is not hypothetical or imaginary problems.
                            Whether you will own a practice, or will work with someone who does, eventually this
                            practice will change their software. And you will have to deal with it.
