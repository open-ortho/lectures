                <h2>Problem 1</h2>
                <h3>Sharing Data</h3>
                <img alt="The cartoon depicts a humorous and exaggerated scene of two people in white coats, presumably medical professionals or researchers, working at desks. They each have a computer monitor, and their desks are side by side. One medical provider leans dramatically over their desk and through their own monitor, reaching into the screen of the other providers's computer. The other doctor tries to do the same, stretching in an attempt to see the screen of their colleague. The scene suggests a struggle trying to align or synchronize something on their screens, indicating difficulties with compatibility or communication between systems or devices. The overall tone is playful and illustrates a humorous take on a technical or interoperability challenge."
