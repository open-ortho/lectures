                <img alt="This cartoon depicts a person in a dress and a doctor in a lab coat stand facing each other, holding two plugs that don't seem to fit together. They both have confused expressions, with question marks above their heads. In the background, on the doctor's side, a patient is reclining in a dental chair, while the person on the other side stands near an office desk with a computer. The scene humorously suggests a communication or compatibility issue between the two sides."
