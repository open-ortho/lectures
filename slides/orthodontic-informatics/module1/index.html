                <img alt="The cartoon depicts a humorous and exaggerated scene of two people in white coats, presumably medical professionals or researchers, working at desks. They each have a computer monitor, and their desks are side by side. One medical provider leans dramatically over their desk and through their own monitor, reaching into the screen of the other providers's computer. The other doctor tries to do the same, stretching in an attempt to see the screen of their colleague. The scene suggests a struggle trying to align or synchronize something on their screens, indicating difficulties with compatibility or communication between systems or devices. The overall tone is playful and illustrates a humorous take on a technical or interoperability challenge."

                            practice will change their software. And you will have to deal with it.

                    Most software will let you import or export patient data like photographs or radiographs, in some
                    cases even in DICOM. However, orthodontic software will typically not let you export the work you did with their software (like anatomical landmark selection, image type identification, clinical entries, treatment plans, ...) using a standard machine readable way in such a way to let you continue your work from another software. They might let you export in some non-modifiable format, like PDF, composite images or screenshots. Do you see the difference?
