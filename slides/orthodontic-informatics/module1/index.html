                <img alt="The cartoon depicts a humorous and exaggerated scene of two people in white coats, presumably medical professionals or researchers, working at desks. They each have a computer monitor, and their desks are side by side. One medical provider leans dramatically over their desk and through their own monitor, reaching into the screen of the other providers's computer. The other doctor tries to do the same, stretching in an attempt to see the screen of their colleague. The scene suggests a struggle trying to align or synchronize something on their screens, indicating difficulties with compatibility or communication between systems or devices. The overall tone is playful and illustrates a humorous take on a technical or interoperability challenge."

                            Awareness of data ownership is growing and governments are adding regulations (21st Century

                            Just like there are patients who try to make money by catching medical providers make
                            clinical mistakes, there will soon be more and more patients doing the same with how
                            clinical data is handled.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Example of Lisy: patient wanted to sew for incorrect dosage of radiopharmaceutical. However,
                            hospital was tracking everything, and patient couldn't go anywhere. But if patient would
                            have accused the hospital of improper data handling, they would have scored without
                            problems. It's like shooting blindfolded: you will hit someone, if everyone is doing it.

The diagram shows data being transformed from one format or structure to another, with arrows indicating the flow between different stages or steps of conversion. This could represent migrating data between software systems, such as converting patient records into a new format for compatibility with a new practice management system."
